# Hi, I'm Alan.

I live in _Buenos Aires, Argentina_.

This is my personal website where you can get to know me better.

I'm a [Software Engineer][Linkedin]{:.icon-linkedin target="_blank"} and I spend a lot of time [coding][Github]{:.icon-github target="_blank"}, leading teams, participating in meetings and [meetups][Meetup]{:.icon-meetup target="_blank"}, learning, [teaching][frontend-training]{:target="_blank"}, interviewing, coaching &amp; mentoring.

I also like [reading][Goodreads]{:.icon-book-open target="_blank"}, [writing][blog]{:.icon-feather target="_blank"}, playing the [keyboards][SoundCloud]{:.icon-soundcloud target="_blank"} and soccer, among [other things][about-me].

You can contact me via [Twitter]{:.icon-twitter target="_blank"} / [email]({{ site.email }}){:.icon-mail href="mailto:{{ site.email }}"} to ask me a question or just to say hi.
