## Traveling

> “Traveling – it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.” – Ibn Battuta

If I had to choose one thing that really defines me, I'd say that's traveling – and everything that goes with it: visiting new places, meeting people from other cultures, escaping the routine, etc.

### Eurotrip

After graduating from Engineering school in Argentina, 2 friends and I decided to **travel around Europe for 1 month**.

It was my first experience travelling abroad and it _blew my head_.

We had a great time visiting Rome, Florence, Venice, Prague, Berlin, Amsterdam, Bruges, Paris and London.

### Chicago, USA

A few months after the Eurotrip, an opportunity presented to travel to Chicago due to work reasons.

I stayed there for a month and I fell in love with the multi-level _windy city_.

### New York, USA

And after that I travelled to NYC on 2 ocassions (again work related trips), the first time during summer and the second during winter.

On both trips I stayed around 3 weeks, and I saw it as a great opportunity to visit other cities which were close.

### Machupichu, Perú

The most challenging trip of my life.

Together with 5 more friends, we walked the **4-day Inca Trail to Machupichu**.

## Music

I really enjoy playing the **keyboards** every now and then.

I also recorded a few songs for fun and uploaded them to SoundCloud.

## Soccer

My favorite sport, which I like playing more than watching.

In Argentina, I support Independiente, still known as _El Rey de Copas_.

It may not be Barça, but Independiente has it's handful of international cups and a very rich history.
