I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina – where I'm currently living.

I like building things, but what I enjoy the most is leading people towards a common goal and the feeling of fulfillment that comes after accomplishing it.

I'm a Software Engineer, the kind that has Star Wars bobble head figures on his desk and a Batman vinyl sticker on his laptop :D

## Traveling

> “Traveling – it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.” – Ibn Battuta

If I had to choose one thing that really defines me, I'd say that's traveling – and everything that goes with it: visiting new places, meeting people from other cultures, escaping the routine, etc.

### Eurotrip

After graduating from Engineering school in Argentina, 2 friends and I decided to **travel around Europe for 1 month**.

It was my first experience travelling abroad and it _blew my head_.

We had a great time visiting Rome, Florence, Venice, Prague, Berlin, Amsterdam, Bruges, Paris and London.

### Chicago, USA

A few months after the Eurotrip, an opportunity presented to travel to Chicago due to work reasons.

I stayed there for a month and I fell in love with the multi-level _windy city_.

### New York, USA

And after that I travelled to NYC on 4 ocassions (again work related trips), two times during summer and the other two during winter.

On these trips I stayed around 3 weeks, and I saw it as a great opportunity to visit other cities which were close.

### Machupichu, Perú

The most challenging trip of my life.

Together with 5 friends, we hiked through the **4-day Inca Trail to Machupichu**.

## Music

My dad taught me how to play the **keyboards** when I was a young boy, and I really enjoy playing every now and then.

I also recorded a few songs for fun and uploaded them to SoundCloud.

## Sports

Soccer is my favorite sport, which I like playing more than watching.

In Argentina, I support Independiente, still known as _El Rey de Copas_.

It may not be Barça, but Independiente has it's handful of international cups and a very rich history.
